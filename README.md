# Professional De-crafter

Professional De-crafter is a short but fun and frenetic game inspired by Overcooked that was made for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam of 2023. The goal is simple, de-craft all the items into different parts so that you can meet the deadline.

This proyect has been made by 2 people, Pablo Lario (Programmer) and Ángel Martínez (Artist), using the Unity Engine and C#. The art has been drawn first on a notebook, then scanned and cleaned using Photoshop to give the mood and texture that it has.
